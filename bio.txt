About Me
Welcome to my developer site. I started my career in programming at IBM in the early 90s and later worked with GEC Plessey writing programs for the telecoms infrastructure.

My first degree is in Computer Science and I have always been involved in technology companies, large and small. In the late 90s, I moved to the commercial side of technology, holding various roles in sales, marketing and operations.

My love of programming and in particular data science never diminished and throughout my mid career, I have worked on many quantitative and qualitative business data projects.

And now, I want to create and deploy data analytics with the power and flexibility offered by Python to the developer community and my clients!
